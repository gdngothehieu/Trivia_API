# Full Stack Trivia Project

## Description

Full Stack Trivia is an educational project developed by Udacity that allows students to improve their software development skills.
At the end, with the codes properly implemented, any user will have the ability to run a Trivia application, containing:

1. A database with questions and answers on various topics;
2. A keyword search system capable of locating questions according to the desired terms;
3. List of questions by category;
4. Ability to add new questions, measuring the level of difficulty and the desired category;
5. Play new quizzes.
